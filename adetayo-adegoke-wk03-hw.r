# create a new wins column
wins <- Mets$R > Mets$RA; head(wins)

# create index of games that are wins

Y <- numeric(swins)

# Note that while we count success, R does not (different ways of parametrizing the geometric distributuion

# Compute the p-value
pvalue <- pchisq(chisq, df = 2, lower.tail = FALSE); pvalue # 0.4088347
# The p-value is 0.4088347, which means that the the probability of observing a test statistic
# that is as extreme from the relevant Chi-square distribution is 40.88347%.  As such, we can
# say that our data provides insufficient evidence against the null hypothesis which says that
# the data came from a geometric distribution

chisq <- ChiSq(observed, expected); chisq # 1.410858
# There are 5 categories; we set the expected total equal to the actual total
# and then we computed p from the data.  Therefore, we have 5-2 = 3 degrees of freedom

# Compute the p-value
pvalue <- pchisq(chisq, df = 3, lower.tail = FALSE); pvalue # 0.7029915
# The p-value is 0.7029915, which means that the the probability of observing a test statistic
# that is as extreme from the relevant Chi-square distribution is 70.29915%.  As such, we can
# say that our data provides insufficient evidence against the null hypothesis which says that
# the data came from a geometric distribution

P <-c((6/pi^2)*(1/(1:999)^2), .0006082); head(P) #create vector

Expt <- sum((1:1000) * P); Expt # 5.158213

# Questions 2 (d)

# Questions 3

rm(list = ls()) # clear console

# install pakcages
library(resampledata)

# Get Lottery dataset
Lottery <- get("Lottery"); head(Lottery)
table(Lottery) # Counts are all greater than 5 so we are good

M <- nrow(Lottery) # number of rows in the Lottery data set

observed <- as.vector(table(Lottery)); observed

# Compute how many numbers we are working on
Length <- length(observed); Length # size of the observed vector
length(table(Lottery)) # size of the table of Lottery data

# There are 39 numbers, and our null hypothesesis is that they are all equally
# likely to be drawn

# Create the expected vectors, with each of its 39 elements haveing a probability of 
# 1/39 of being drawn.  There are M = 500 observations
expected <- M * c(rep(1/Length, Length)); expected
sum(expected); M # check that the sum of the expected equals 500 which it does

# Define and compute Chi-Squared Statistic
ChiSq <- function(Obs, Exp){
  sum((Obs - Exp) ^ 2 / Exp)
}
chisq <- ChiSq(observed, expected); chisq # value is 33.676 which is really large

df <- Length - 1; diff # degrees of freedom is 38
# note that there are N categories.  We made the expected total equal to the actual total number of 
# observations, so that we have N-1 degrees of freedom = 39 - 1 = 38

# Compute the p-value
pvalue <- pchisq(chisq, df, lower.tail = FALSE); pvalue # 0.669616
# The p-value is 0.669616, which means that the the probability of observing a test statistic
# that is as extreme from the relevant Chi-square distribution is 66.9616%.  As such, we can
# say that our data provides insufficient evidence against  the null hypothesis which says that
# the data came from a uniform distribution


# Questions 4

Redsox <- read.csv("RedSox2013.csv"); head(Redsox)
Nats <- read.csv("Nats2019.csv"); head(Nats)

# Extracting Runs and Runs Against columns into a single data vector
Y <- c(Redsox$R, Redsox$RA, Nats$R, Nats$RA)
Length <- length(Y) # 680, which is > 600


# Questions 4 (a)

# Bar plot showing the number of runs scored by the teams
barplot(table(Y),
        xlab = "Number of Runs",
        ylab = "Number of Games",
        col = "blue")


# Questions 4 (b)

# Note that if the data above is modeled by a Poisson distribution then lambda will be its mean
lambda <- mean(Y); lambda # value is 4.738235

# Note that for a poisson ramdom variable Y, E(Y) = Var(Y) = lambda
var(Y) # value of variance is 11.14493 which means a poisson is not the way to go here


# Questions 4 (c)

table(Y) 

# Lets us select number of runs sets that occurred in at 5 games as a general rule of thumb 
# for the chi-squared test.  We will pool together data >= 14 so that we have 15 bins in total
# Our bins will be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 and >= 14
observed <- numeric(15) # create an empty vector
for (i in 1:14) {
  observed[i] <- table(Y)[i]
}
observed[15] <- sum(table(Y)[15:20])
observed; table(Y) # check values
sum(observed) == Length # chek that the sum of observed is the same size as Y

# Note that Poisson takes on integer values
# P(Y >= 14) = P(Y > 13)
expected <- Length * c(dpois(0:13, lambda), ppois(13, lambda, lower.tail = FALSE))

# Checking calculations above
sum(dpois(0:13, lambda)) + ppois(13, lambda, lower.tail = FALSE) # sum of probabilities equals to 1
sum(expected) == Length # length of the expected vector and Y are equal as well <- 680

df <- 15-3 # degrees of freedom

# Define and compute Chi-Squared Statistic
ChiSq <- function(Obs, Exp){
  sum((Obs - Exp) ^ 2 / Exp)
}
chisq <- ChiSq(observed, expected); chisq # value is 1101.949 which is really large

pvalue <- pchisq(chisq, df, lower.tail = FALSE); pvalue # 2.213952e-228
# The p-value is really close to zero, which means that the the probability of observing a test statistic
# that is as extreme from the relevant Chi-square distribution is essentially zero.  As such, we can
# reject the null hypothesis that the data came from a Poisson distribution with parameter lambda
